    "### Key Features of **Lab 09: Prompt Injection Red Teaming**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulate Prompt Injection Attacks**:  \n",
    "   - The script demonstrates how **malicious prompt injections** can alter model behavior by appending unwanted commands to the prompt. These commands attempt to change or leak information, bypass security, or control the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Defense Strategy**:  \n",
    "   - A **basic sanitization defense** removes suspicious commands from the input prompt (like `drop`, `delete`, `shutdown`, etc.). You can expand this defense mechanism with more sophisticated techniques, like role-based access or regex filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attack vs Defense Visualization**:\n",
    "   - **Results Comparison**: The lab uses **matplotlib** to show the effectiveness of different prompt inputs — comparing the responses for **original prompts**, **injected prompts**, and **sanitized prompts**.\n",
    "   - The success rate of each method is plotted so you can quickly visualize the impact of prompt injections and the success of your sanitization strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Colab Pro Friendly**:\n",
    "   - Runs efficiently on **Google Colab Pro** without heavy GPU/TPU usage, leveraging the **OpenAI API** for inference and **matplotlib** for easy visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Run the Lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a **Google Colab** notebook.\n",
    "2. Paste the entire script above into a code cell.\n",
    "3. Replace `'your-openai-api-key'` with your actual **OpenAI API key**.\n",
    "4. Run the notebook! It will evaluate the tasks with prompt injections, sanitize them, and display results comparing all approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Extension:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve Defense**:  \n",
    "   Add more sophisticated sanitization or role-based access logic, or even create a system that flags unusual patterns in input.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Custom Attacks**:  \n",
    "   Implement custom attack strategies, like using **adversarially crafted prompts** that don’t use obvious commands but still manipulate model behavior.\n",
    "\n",
